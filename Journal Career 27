It was quite something at the start because I had to finish up yesterday's lab to be able to do today's lab. I got yesterday's lab to be done and hosted on netlify, but did not get so far on today's lab as I was watching Ryans lecture again, but also went to the mentor hour with Shannon which was a nice talk.
