Going into the lab i felt really great because it was pretty much a redo of the last 2 days of labs but with a twist with join, however because I got lost on my original naming sense and tables and how they related with each other, i had to change it mid way which just took time to do. But when i was finishing it up i ran into the problem where my find by id was giving me a empty object and somehow commenting on the routes page (app.js) it somehow worked.
