Yesterday (wednesday) was going well. I finally decided to use a library for the carousel and it was so much easier than expected and i gotta say it turned out better than i expected too, we all work well with each other and give each person's thoughts and opinions actual discussions on how the project would play out.Â  Of course there is a lot of links to videos that people send me because I don't get their references which is to me kinda funny. (during break times).
