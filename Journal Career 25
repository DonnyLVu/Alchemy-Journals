What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

I got the avatar list to render onto it, while getting Id to be in the url

What did I learn today?

Start of how to use hooks

What should I do differently next time?

Got sidetracked of dealing with personal issues

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

If really the only big difference from hooks and class is just one can make custom hooks.
