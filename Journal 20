What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Worked well together, lots of ideas which worked and some didn't. MVP was working and deployed.

What did I learn today?

For some reason images was on the harder side of doing this as it needed to be imported separately for some reason but worked in the end.

What should I do differently next time?

Be more ready to ask for help rather than waiting for long periods of time stuck on something.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

When I need to use a / or not on anything that i do
