Today was quite interesting, we finally have some sort of thin to show that we are doing things in a very cool way (prismarine-viewer). Plus with getting the AWS to be the main thing that we use for that is also super nice, but from Ryan walking through that it was quite something. Lots of installations, commands, sudo stuff and all that. We at this point are deciding what direction that we are going in based on the limitation of the technologies that we are using so that will be lots of ideas and mix mashing them all around and finding the perfect one that is achievable in time span and that looks and runs well is a challenge that needs to be done.Â
