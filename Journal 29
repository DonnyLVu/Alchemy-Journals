Morning portion What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

The weather and location works and evens displays on live site

What did I learn today?

There is just lots of keys and should be treated with care to not give away

What should I do differently next time?Spend longer at night to work on them and really if not done finish them in weekend to not be overwhelmed by new labs

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

How to get my yelp one to workIs the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains

?Not done, yelp and trails written but need to edit to actually work, needs to write the tests for all.
