What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
Tests passed initially but now broke.

What did I learn today?
How to make those tables to have different category like spots so it looks like a data table.

What should I do differently next time?
Probably not go to a meetup on a hard week.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
Where all my datas are at to change them into the new updated rangers and colors.js.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
No, Fix tests so they would work again with updated stuff. Then do the rest of the front end stuff.
