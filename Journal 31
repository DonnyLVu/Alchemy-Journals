Writing this as todays labWhat went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

Couldn't get true or false to work because i forgot how but then decided to do line through for the ease.

What did I learn today?

How to use user Auth to display users specific data on the front end 

What should I do differently next time?

If stuff is not working do workarounds which would work

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Nothing really, I do need to fix up precious labs because i forgot to do so.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Finished i think.
