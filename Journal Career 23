What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

I have stuff to render dynamically and its really fast.

What did I learn today?

How more to do snapshots but didn't get to do it so far as rendering the links was hard.

What should I do differently next time?

Probably do snapshot tests as i go along on making the things render rather than waiting to do it after.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Nothing really, just gotta get around to do the testing for it
