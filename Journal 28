What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

Had all the correct functions for the react app but had the states reversed.

What did I learn today?

It's confusing to have similar names that do different things aka ranger_color_id and ranger_color

What should I do differently next time?Give better names to tell difference between variables

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

How to not get confused between back end talking to front end and not get stuff mixed up

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

Yes but CSS does look that good.
