What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

The lab is basically just the same lab as the lab before, but with more variables and all around files to do.

What did I learn today?

The newer cohort projects are quite nice.

What should I do differently next time?

Work more on fridays and not take it as a easier day.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

On lab, just gotta do the tests and css for it.
