Today is the day, we are going to finally present after a weeksworth of coding as a team. Perry and I are mainly doing the technical parts aka the functions and their functionality of it while Katie and Richard are doing the front end which is becasuse they did more front end making it look all nice and pretty betweeen the pages while the rest of us did the game portion. It was an interesting expericence that showed how it would be working together with 3 other people.
