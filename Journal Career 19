Today was quite good. The problem with the server being hosted and if we are willing to pay to do so was solved with somehow running the server with only 500mb of ram which is surprising. We finally decided on doing a maze with the bots so that we could have the least amount of complexity with it for simple commands like turning right, left, forward and back. Possible time leaderboard of how fast people can navigate through it via text and first person bots only.
