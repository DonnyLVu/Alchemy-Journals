What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Added the componentDidMount part which is a very useful thing where it launches something on first load.

What did I learn today?

My search function only works if you spell out the name out fully.

What should I do differently next time?

Check my code more often in the browser rather than working in code for long time then look as you could be doing something entirely wrong.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

How fetching apis would give you its data. Will be watching the recordings later on today about it.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

No not done, need to link api to code. Will get it done in morning.
