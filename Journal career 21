What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

I finished the lab with only help from TAs twice which was a simple misunderstanding first and second how to install babel.

What did I learn today?

how to write up web packets but basic ones

What should I do differently next time?

Read the docs for babel more

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Nope all good!
