Today was lab 6 part 3 which is to add local storage of data on one page and brings it to the cart page. I think the hardest for me was on how to start this as when we started todays lab, I was getting caught up with the previous days work which i finished after an hour. Then when I started todays work It was basically goin over my head but witht he help from examples and fellow peers I had the rough idea oh how to start it, with Dani's code as a reference to check if its working correctly I kept typing.
