What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Apps are written but tests don't pass.What did I learn today?how to create app.js components that would also pass the tests that we created.

What should I do differently next time?

Join calls that have more people as there is a lot of help there.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?How to get my tests to pass and not get skipped.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?No its not complete. Written app but not passing tests.
