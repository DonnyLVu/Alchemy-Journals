Today we went over how to make static cart page. It was quite a bit more difficult than yesterdays but thats to be expected. Ive stopped for today around the part where calcORderItems was finished or is almost finish and has yet to be used in the totalling of the subtotals. Took 8 hours and was stuck often but pushed through.
