Today was the first day of project week, with the whole minecraft stuff it was very interesting.  Seeing all the data that you could get was very nice to see. In the beginning it was hard because it was (the npm) to download had problems using yo to create the files needed. But it worked out and i ended it with the creation  of the needed files so yay.
