I guess this article hits closer to me than everyone else. As I don't know where I would fit on that chart. Which I'm technically an adult at age 18 but also skipped out on half of senior year of school. Am I both motivated by self growth as well as seeing a grade for what i'm doing? I also don't have that much personal experience that things can be built upon as much as the other people in the cohorts as of yet.
