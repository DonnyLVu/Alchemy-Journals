We worked and tweaked alittle bit of the styling earlier today so that was nerve wracking. Everyone's projects looked so clean and im so impressed with everyone. I am so excited to graduate from the foundations and go into career track where i feel like its going to be more of the refinement of skills we created during this 9 weeks.
