What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Clean distinct sections made it less messy to work on and find stuff.

What did I learn today?

Many different roles other than full stack, front and back etc.

Using filters and listing/displaying them.

What should I do differently next time?

Commit more often as my laptop crashed once which made it lose a chunk off which I got back later on.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

CSS still puzzles me because I really don't use it that much as I usually leave it pretty bare instead of all customized.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

I think so, might need to add stuff later on if i can think of anything.
