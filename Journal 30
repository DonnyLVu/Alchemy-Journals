AfternoonWhat went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Set up correctly, just have to write tests and edit app to display correct data.

What did I learn today?

How to create Auth for users

What should I do differently next time?

Work on project at same time others are getting help instead of being invested in the helping.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

What to do after getting the key from user.Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

No, got key, don't know what to do with it, wrote app get put and post but no clue if works or not. Need to write tests for them i think as well.
