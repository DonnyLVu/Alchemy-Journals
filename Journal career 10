What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?The process of actually going through todays lab was easier than expect after going through it already. The questions i usually have when doing the labs usually gets answered ny peers who already had the problem before and because of that it went more smoothly than normal.What did I learn today?How to debug stuff when given a 404 error from the middleware. Plus using express more.What should I do differently next time?Probably just the same as how it was for today, lots of progress, lots of AC, work on different branch before refactoring.What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?JSONB was a little hard at first then had someone explain it which helped in process of doing the 1 point for the labIs the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?Done!
