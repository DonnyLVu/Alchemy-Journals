Today I had a coffee date with Mack Berliner-Glasser, he was a very nice guy who gave me an advice of to instead of treating this place as a school but to treat it as a job instead, he also said communication is a very very key soft skill especially on how things are nowadays. After that I went to the TechCrawl where lots of speakers where there who are really interested in their fields which was a nice sight to see.
