What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
The search function works but the filter doesn't.What did I learn today?how app.js is where you should have your states.

What should I do differently next time?
Focus on one aspect of it and continue doing so till I need other stuff to complete the first thing.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
The formatting of moving the states into app instead of ImageList and ImageItem, It does the same stuff but for some reason a little harder to do.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
No, i need to make filters filter out the pokemon. However search bar works but is very case sensitive. Also need to make it look better (css)
