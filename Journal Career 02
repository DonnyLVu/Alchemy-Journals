Today went worse than yesterday around the 3rd mark as it was a lot easier to do 1 and 2 pretty much on my own, with progressively more and more help needed as I finish the current one. Being able to have it run is a lot easier because its to do whatever you can to pass it. Hard part is to refactor it so that it still works. But eventually did finish them all with some TA help towards the end.
