Today we went over the first pair programing so far of the program. I paired up with Ryan and we worked on our projects. Dani helped solve the issues of my code not having a pure function and having a impure one instead. Which i had my code mutate instead of having it be cleaner than how it could be like now for instance. We went over better ways to set up my functions because my random number code didnt spit out a number but the entire code nested and all of instead. It got fixed out though by then end and now it works. I do have to fix how the reset works for it to count how many resets that happened.
