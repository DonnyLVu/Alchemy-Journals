Today we worked on the simple game of rock paper scissors. The entire code was kind of complicated as im not to advance on coding so i have lots of if and else if throughout the code. We also had the networking event where foundation 1(us) get to talk to career track indivudals in zoom breakout rooms. It was pretty interesting hearing their take on how Alchemy is like for them.
