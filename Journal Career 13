Today was a more chill day which I suspect is because we came back from a long break, just like with all the models and routes we did before, practice the same things which in this case for all the exercises we did today, helped on how you would traverse your way through using the model. In the end I also had the error with the CI with the time zone stuff which seems like lots are having problems on that as well but got solved by the end.
