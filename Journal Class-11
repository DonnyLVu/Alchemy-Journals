On a scale of 1 to 10 on my own imposter syndrome i think it would be like something of a 7 because I'm always slower than others (granted im also faster than others) but i'll also need more help then everyone else because of mistakes. Also because of how old i am, i feel like i'm cheating this or just like i didn't work for this.
