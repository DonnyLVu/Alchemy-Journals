Today went pretty well, we had a lot more progress on the back end than what I thought we would get based on how lost we were from friday and today morning, TA help was a very needed thing. We got most of the back end wrapped up and for some reason have an error that says on post man that the owner_id is ambiguous. Jonathan and I were in charge of back end more an Justin and David were front end. I called on some of my friends from school and got someone to come up with a neat little logo for this which is something i'm excited to see.
