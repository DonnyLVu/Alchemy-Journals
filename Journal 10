And we are in the double didgits, congrats me! Well on friday we worked on the chocolate pizza where we had to just like the cragslist website copy that page because we had a presentation from career track that was super cool. They were a message board for alemists and a stock viewer to do stocks at, as well as a terminal story and a vote bot. They were all unique from eachother and all worked really well. Crazy to see how we are going to be in a couple of months.
