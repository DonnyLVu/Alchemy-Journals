Today was a nice and relaxing day, i spend most of the time working on the code challenge then went and helped people on theirs as well. I tried to start my portfolio site but had trouble coming up with ideas with how it'll look like but then i also got side tracked with a library called three.js which seems like a fun little side project to keep myself busy and is a just for fun type of thing.
