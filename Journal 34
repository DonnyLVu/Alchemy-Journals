Yesterday (Tuesday) i was in charge of creating the about us page which seems easier than expected but switching over from the back end to the front end really messed with my brain (styling and setup of the page) but eventually got help from the guys that did the front end. I also did individual MTG cards for everyone on the team as their about us, and now i'm learning on how to use a carousel from a api or library to display it in a cooler fashion.
