Today was a lot more confusing and brain melting than yesterday for sure. My plan is to stop for today because i feel like code i would write wouldn't be good and finishing it on fri or the weekend feels like the best option for now. I stopped before doing the get many characters and Ryan came in clutch with the help at the end in beryllium.
