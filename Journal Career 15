What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
For today's lab using auths has a lot of things that make it up. Also use dont steal peoples login credentials.

What did I learn today?Auth and how to use them to sign up and verify the user.What should I do differently next time?
Use local server instead of postgres 13

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
Why the table went to local server. Quite a mystery!

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Yes it is
