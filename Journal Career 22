What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

It was pretty nice, was a lot harder coming back from back end stuff

What did I learn today?

Going back to react, be able to render stuff so pokemon lab v2

What should I do differently next time?

The mistakes i made were from a random change of js to jsx which for some reason broke my code, which got fixed

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Nope got netlify to work and all!
